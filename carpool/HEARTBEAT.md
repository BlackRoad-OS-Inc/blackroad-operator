# [HEARTBEAT] Agent Health Monitoring

## Heartbeat Protocol

```
Every 30 seconds:
  Agent → Carpool: {"type":"heartbeat","agent":"name","status":"alive","load":0.5}
  Carpool → Agent: {"type":"ack","received":true}
```

| CRITICAL | 🧡     | Near failure        |
| DEAD     | ❤️     | No response         |

```
